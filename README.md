Android Registration Form

This is a simple Android app that showcases how to design a clean and user-friendly registration form using XML in Android Studio. It includes input fields for a user's Name, Phone Number, Gmail, and Password, along with two buttons: one to register and another to log in. The layout is centered on the screen, styled with a purple background and white input fields to give it a modern, clean look.

This project is a great starting point for anyone new to Android development. It focuses purely on the front-end layout and doesn't include backend functionality like saving user data or authentication — but it's a solid base you can build on. You can easily expand it by adding Java or Kotlin logic, connecting it to Firebase, or integrating an API.

To try it out, just clone the repository into Android Studio, run it on your emulator or device, and see how the layout works. Whether you’re building your first Android project or just need a reusable form layout, this example can help.
